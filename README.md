This is a tool for checking the completeness of a WebHelp table of content
comparing to the list of topics in the same WebHelp project.

To check the TOC completeness, run main with two arguments:
* path to the WebHelp project
* name of the TOC XML file

For example:
../kotlin-reference-help/ kr.tree
